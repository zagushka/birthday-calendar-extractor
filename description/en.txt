With this extension, you will:

- Follow and never miss your Facebook friends' birthdays.
- Generate and export a calendar with all your Facebook friends' birthdays to your favorite calendar program.
- See if your friends have a birthday today by checking the extension "cake" icon.
- Have an overview of your friends' birthdays in a "Calendar" view.

The birthdays can be exported in ICS format, which is supported by Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, and Apple Calendar. As well as in CSV format, which is compatible with Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

Use the generated file to import your friends' birthdays into your favorite calendar program. I strongly recommend creating a new Birthday-themed sub-calendar for imports.

FAQ

Question: I have accidentally exported birthdays to my main calendar. How can I reverse this?
Answer: Only Google Calendar properly supports event removal. Head to the "Download Calendar" tab and use "Delete Imported ICS from Google Calendar". A file named `delete-birthday-calendar.ics` will be downloaded. Import this file into the respective calendar.

Question: Is it possible to remove some contacts before importing them into the calendar?
Answer: Yes, you can got to "Calendar" tab and remove contacts from the list by clicking on the "eye" icon next to the contact. And then download the calendar again.
You also use a command-line tool available at: https://github.com/guenter-r/calendar_file_splitter
