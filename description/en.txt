Generate a calendar with all your facebook friends birthdays.
The generated calendar file is saved in `ICS` or `CSV` formats.

How to use
Click on extension icon ("cake") and select one of the required formats:
- Generate Google Calendar - ICS is a universal calendar format used by Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, and Apple Calendar.
- Generate Excel file - CSV
- Remove from Google Calendar - ICS file used to remove previously imported birthday events.

At the end of the process a file named `birthday-calendar.ics` will be downloaded automatically to your Downloads folder.
Use the generated file to import your friends birthdays to your calendar program.
I suggest creating a new Birthday themed sub-calendar and use it for imports.
